This means we need to select all columns from the `sylius_adjustment` table. We'll alias it as `sa`.\n\n2.  **Understand the conditions for filtering:** The adjustments must satisfy one of two conditions related to their associated order:\n    *   Condition A: \"这些调整记录所关联订单的销售渠道是启用的\" (The sales channel of the order associated with these adjustment records is enabled).\n    *   Condition B: \"或者这些调整记录所关联订单的状态不是‘已取消’\" (Or the state of the order associated with these adjustment records is not 'cancelled').\n    The \"或者\" (or) indicates that if either Condition A or Condition B (or both) is true, the adjustment record should be included.\n\n3.  **Determine the necessary tables and joins to access the information for the conditions:**\n    *   `sylius_adjustment` (`sa`): The source of the records and the final output.\n    *   To link an adjustment to an order, we need to know the schema relationship. Based on common Sylius structures and inferring from the structure implied by join patterns often seen (like in the reference, though we are not directly using it), adjustments might be linked to orders via shipments. So, we'll assume the path:\n        *   `sylius_adjustment` (`sa`) has a `shipment_id`.\n        *   `sylius_shipment` (`ss`) has an `id` (PK) and an `order_id` (FK to `sylius_order`).\n        *   `sylius_order` (`so`) has an `id` (PK) and a `channel_id` (FK to `sylius_channel`), and a `state` column.\n        *   `sylius_channel` (`sc`) has an `id` (PK) and an `enabled` column.\n\n    *   The joins will be:\n        *   `sylius_adjustment AS sa`\n        *   `INNER JOIN sylius_shipment AS ss ON sa.shipment_id = ss.id` (to link adjustment to shipment)\n        *   `INNER JOIN sylius_order AS so ON ss.order_id = so.id` (to link shipment to order)\n        *   `INNER JOIN sylius_channel AS sc ON so.channel_id = sc.id` (to link order to sales channel)\n        We use `INNER JOIN` because an adjustment record must be associated with an order and a channel to evaluate the conditions.\n\n4.  **Translate the conditions into SQL expressions:**\n    *   Condition A: \"销售渠道是启用的\" (sales channel is enabled). This typically means a boolean column `enabled` in the `sylius_channel` table is true. Assuming `1` represents enabled: `sc.enabled = 1`.\n    *   Condition B: \"订单的状态不是‘已取消’\" (order's state is not 'cancelled'). This means the `state` column in the `sylius_order` table is not equal to 'cancelled': `so.state != 'cancelled'`.\n\n5.  **Combine the conditions in the `WHERE` clause:** Since either condition is sufficient, we use the `OR` operator: `WHERE sc.enabled = 1 OR so.state != 'cancelled'`.\n\n6.  **Construct the final query:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  sa.*\nFROM sylius_adjustment AS sa\nINNER JOIN sylius_shipment AS ss\n  ON sa.shipment_id = ss.id\nINNER JOIN sylius_order AS so\n  ON ss.order_id = so.id\nINNER JOIN sylius_channel AS sc\n  ON so.channel_id = sc.id\nWHERE\n  sc.enabled = 1 OR so.state != 'cancelled';\n```", "db_name": "sylius-database", "result": [[1, 33, 61, 66, "fee", "Intellegi potest quanta voluptas sit non dolere.

{"question": "对于我们记录中的每一位联系人，能否列出他们不重复的名字、姓氏、性别，以及他们各自有多少笔债务？", "sql": "SELECT DISTINCT\n    c.first_name,\n    c.last_name,\n    g.name AS gender,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id) AS number_of_debts\nFROM\n    contacts c\nLEFT JOIN\n    genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id;", "cot": "Okay, let's break down the request and construct the SQL query step by step.\n\nThe user wants a list of contacts with their first name, last name, gender, and the count of their debts. The key phrases are \"for each contact\" and \"how many debts *they* have,\" indicating we need to process each contact individually. The request also specifies \"不重复的名字、姓氏、性别\" (distinct first name, last name, gender).\n\n1.  **Identify Core Information Needed:**\n    *   Contact's first name\n    *   Contact's last name\n    *   Contact's gender (name, not ID)\n    *   Number of debts for that specific contact\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Tables:**\n    *   `contacts`: This table will provide `first_name`, `last_name`, and `gender_id`. Let's alias it as `c`.\n    *   `genders`: This table will map `gender_id` from `contacts` to the actual gender `name`. Let's alias it as `g`.\n    *   `debts`: This table contains information about debts and links back to contacts via `contact_id`. Let's alias it as `d`.\n\n3.  **Start with the Primary Entity (Contacts):**\n    We want information \"for each contact,\" so `contacts` will be our main table in the `FROM` clause.\n    `SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name ... FROM contacts c`\n\n4.  **Get Gender Name:**\n    The `contacts` table has `gender_id`. We need to join with the `genders` table to get the gender name. A `LEFT JOIN` is appropriate because we want all contacts, even if (hypothetically) a gender mapping was missing.\n    `... LEFT JOIN genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id`\n    Now we can select `g.name AS gender`.\n\n5.  **Count Debts for Each Contact:**\n    For each contact row from the `contacts` table, we need to count how many entries exist in the `debts` table that correspond to that contact's ID. A correlated subquery is a clean way to achieve this.\n    The subquery will look like: `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id)`\n    This subquery is \"correlated\" because `c.id` refers to the `id` of the current contact row being processed by the outer query.\n    We'll alias this count: `AS number_of_debts`.\n\n6.  **Handle \"不重复的\" (Distinct):**\n    The request asks for \"不重复的名字、姓氏、性别\".\n    If we are processing each contact record (identified by `c.id`) and the combination of `c.first_name`, `c.last_name`, and `g.name` is what we are selecting, and if `c.id` is the primary key of the `contacts` table, then each row produced by the `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses (before aggregation or subqueries that operate per `c.id`) will already represent a unique contact.\n    The subquery calculates the debt count specifically for each `c.id`.\n    If the `contacts` table itself could have multiple rows for the exact same person (same `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender_id`) but *different* `id`s, then each would be listed with their respective debt counts.\n    If the `contacts` table could have fully duplicate rows (same `id`, `first_name`, etc.), this would be a data integrity issue.\n    Assuming `contacts.id` is a primary key, each row fetched from `contacts c` is unique. The `LEFT JOIN` to `genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id` (assuming `g.id` is PK of `genders`) will not create duplicate rows for a single contact. The subquery counts debts per `c.id`. Therefore, `DISTINCT` on the selected columns in the outer query is not strictly necessary if the goal is one row per distinct contact *entity* (identified by `c.id`).\n    However, if the intent of \"不重复的\" is to ensure that if two *different* contacts (different `c.id`) happen to have the same first name, last name, and gender, they are still listed separately (because the debt count is \"各自有多少\" - how many *each* has), then `DISTINCT` is not what we want, as it would collapse them and show the debt count for only one.\n    The most natural interpretation is that we want one row per contact record from the `contacts` table. In this case, `DISTINCT` is redundant if `c.id` is the primary key. The reference solution uses `DISTINCT`, which doesn't harm correctness here but isn't strictly required if the underlying data has unique contact IDs. For clarity and adherence to the \"不重复的\" phrasing, keeping `DISTINCT` is acceptable, though it might imply a different meaning if not carefully considered. Given the structure, it effectively acts as `DISTINCT` on the contact entity.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Query:**\n\n    ```sql\n    SELECT DISTINCT\n        c.first_name,\n        c.last_name,\n        g.name AS gender,\n        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id) AS number_of_debts\n    FROM\n        contacts c\n    LEFT JOIN\n        genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id;\n    ```\n    Upon review, the `DISTINCT` keyword applies to the combination of `c.first_name`, `c.last_name`, `g.name`, and the result of the subquery. Since the subquery is tied to `c.id`, and assuming `c.id` is the primary key for `contacts`, each row from `contacts c` (and its join with `genders`) will already be unique with respect to the contact entity. Therefore, the `DISTINCT` is likely redundant. A simpler query without `DISTINCT` would achieve the same result if `contacts.id` ensures uniqueness of contacts.\n\n    Let's refine to the most direct query assuming `contacts.id` is unique for each contact:\n\n    ```sql\n    SELECT\n        c.first_name,\n        c.last_name,\n        g.name AS gender,\n        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id) AS number_of_debts\n    FROM\n        contacts c\n    LEFT JOIN\n        genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id;\n    ```\n    This query lists each contact from the `contacts` table along with their details and specific debt count. The phrasing \"不重复的名字、姓氏、性别\" is satisfied by the fact that we are reporting on each contact entity. If there were two distinct contacts (different IDs) with the same name and gender, they would both appear, each with their own debt count, which aligns with \"他们各自有多少笔债务\" (how many debts *each of them* has).\n\nThe reference solution is good and correctly interprets the request. The `DISTINCT` is technically not essential if `contacts.id` is a primary key and uniquely identifies each contact person, as the query structure already processes each contact distinctly. However, its inclusion doesn't alter the correctness of the result in this common scenario. I will stick to a version similar to the reference as it's a common pattern.\n\nFinal check:\n- \"每一位联系人\" (for each contact): Yes, `FROM contacts c` and the subquery is per `c.id`.\n- \"不重复的名字、姓氏、性别\" (distinct first name, last name, gender): `SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, g.name`. The `DISTINCT` in the reference handles cases where the join might produce duplicates, or if the user strictly wants unique combinations of these three fields (though the debt count association becomes tricky then). Given \"他们各自有多少笔债务\", it's more about each contact.\n- \"以及他们各自有多少笔债务\" (and how many debts each of them has): The correlated subquery `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id)` does this perfectly.\n\nThe reference solution is robust.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    c.first_name,\n    c.last_name,\n    g.name AS gender,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id) AS number_of_debts\nFROM\n    contacts c\nLEFT JOIN\n    genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id;\n```\nThe request \"不重复的名字、姓氏、性别\" is slightly ambiguous. If it means that if two *different* contacts (different `id`s) happen to have the exact same first name, last name, and gender, they should only be listed once, then `DISTINCT` on these fields *before* associating the debt count would be needed, but then the debt count becomes problematic (whose debts?). The more natural interpretation, especially with \"他们各自有多少笔债务\" (how many debts *they each* have), is that we list each unique *contact person* and their details. Assuming `contacts.id` is the primary key for contacts, each row from `contacts` is already a unique person. The `LEFT JOIN` to `genders` (assuming `genders.id` is PK) won't create duplicates per contact. Thus, the `DISTINCT` used in the reference solution is not strictly necessary if `contacts.id` is a PK. My proposed query without `DISTINCT` is slightly more performant and directly answers the \"for each contact\" part. The reference solution with `DISTINCT` is also correct in outcome assuming `contacts.id` is PK. I'll provide the one without the redundant `DISTINCT`.\n\nLet's align with the structure of the reference solution as it's provided for guidance, acknowledging the `DISTINCT` might be redundant but not harmful.\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT\n    c.first_name,\n    c.last_name,\n    g.name AS gender,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id) AS number_of_debts\nFROM\n    contacts c\nLEFT JOIN\n    genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id;\n```\nThis query will work. The `DISTINCT` ensures that if, for some reason, the join `contacts c LEFT JOIN genders g` were to produce multiple identical rows for `first_name, last_name, gender, number_of_debts` (which is unlikely if `c.id` is PK and the subquery is deterministic), they would be collapsed. Given the problem structure, it's most likely intended to list each unique contact person.\n\n\nFinal decision: The question \"不重复的名字、姓氏、性别\" alongside \"他们各自有多少笔债务\" implies listing each unique *contact person* with their details. If `contacts.id` is the primary key, then each row from `FROM contacts c` already represents a unique contact. The correlated subquery correctly calculates debts for *that specific contact*. The `LEFT JOIN` to `genders` (assuming `genders.id` is PK) doesn't create duplicate rows for a single contact. Therefore, `DISTINCT` in the main `SELECT` is redundant. The most straightforward and efficient query would omit it.\n\nMy reasoning leads to a query without the top-level `DISTINCT` because the structure (iterating through contacts and using a correlated subquery for counts per contact ID) inherently handles the \"for each contact\" and \"their respective debts\" part. The \"distinct names, surnames, genders\" is satisfied by selecting these fields for each distinct contact.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    c.first_name,\n    c.last_name,\n    g.name AS gender,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id) AS number_of_debts\nFROM\n    contacts c\nLEFT JOIN\n    genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id;\n```\nThis seems the most direct translation.\n\n\nLet's reconsider the \"不重复的\" (distinct). The reference solution includes `DISTINCT`. This implies that the combination of `(c.first_name, c.last_name, g.name, calculated_debt_count)` should be unique in the output.\nIf `contacts.id` is the primary key:\n1. Each row from `contacts c` is unique.\n2. `LEFT JOIN genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id` will join each unique contact row with at most one gender row (assuming `genders.id` is PK). So, `(c.id, c.first_name, c.last_name, g.name)` will be unique.\n3. The subquery `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id)` calculates a debt count for each unique `c.id`. This count is deterministic for a given `c.id`.\nTherefore, the entire row `(c.first_name, c.last_name, g.name, debt_count)` will be unique for each unique contact `c.id`.\nIn this scenario, `DISTINCT` is indeed redundant.\n\nThe only case where `DISTINCT` would make a difference is if:\na) `contacts.id` is NOT a primary key, and there are multiple rows in `contacts` for the exact same person (same `id`, same `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender_id`). The `DISTINCT` would then correctly show that person once.\nb) The join `c.gender_id = g.id` could produce multiple matches (e.g., `genders.id` is not unique). This would be a schema issue.\n\nAssuming a standard schema where `contacts.id` is PK and `genders.id` is PK, the `DISTINCT` is not necessary. I will provide the version without the redundant `DISTINCT` as it's cleaner and slightly more performant by avoiding an unnecessary sort/hash operation for distinctness.\n\nFinal Plan:\n1.  Select `first_name`, `last_name` from `contacts` (alias `c`).\n2.  Join `contacts` with `genders` (alias `g`) on `c.gender_id = g.id` using a `LEFT JOIN` to include all contacts, and select `g.name` as `gender`.\n3.  For each contact, count their debts using a correlated subquery: `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id)`. Name this `number_of_debts`.\n4.  No `GROUP BY` is needed in the outer query because the aggregation is handled by the correlated subquery.\n5.  `DISTINCT` is not necessary if `contacts.id` is a primary key.\n\nThis aligns with the core logic of the reference solution but optimizes by removing a potentially redundant `DISTINCT`.\n\n```markdown\nSELECT\n    c.first_name,\n    c.last_name,\n    g.name AS gender,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id) AS number_of_debts\nFROM\n    contacts c\nLEFT JOIN\n    genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id;\n```\nThe user wants to list each contact's first name, last name, gender, and the total number of debts associated with them. The phrasing \"不重复的名字、姓氏、性别\" (distinct first name, last name, gender) combined with \"他们各自有多少笔债务\" (how many debts each of them has) implies that we should list each unique contact person and their respective debt count.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Main Entity**: The request is centered around \"每一位联系人\" (for each contact). So, the `contacts` table (aliased as `c`) will be the primary table in our `FROM` clause.\n\n2.  **Selecting Contact Details**: We need `first_name` and `last_name` directly from the `contacts` table.\n    `SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name`\n\n3.  **Getting Gender Name**: The `contacts` table likely has a `gender_id`. To get the actual gender name (e.g., \"Male\", \"Female\"), we need to join with the `genders` table (aliased as `g`). A `LEFT JOIN` is suitable here to ensure all contacts are listed, even if their gender information is missing in the `genders` table (though ideally, it wouldn't be). The join condition will be `c.gender_id = g.id`. We will select `g.name` and alias it as `gender`.\n    `... FROM contacts c LEFT JOIN genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id`\n    `SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, g.name AS gender ...`\n\n4.  **Counting Debts**: For each contact, we need to count their debts. The `debts` table (aliased as `d`) contains debt records, and it should have a `contact_id` column linking back to the `contacts` table. A correlated subquery is an effective way to count these debts for each contact row from the outer query.\n    The subquery `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id)` will count all rows in the `debts` table where `contact_id` matches the `id` of the current contact (`c.id`) being processed by the outer query. This count will be a new column, aliased as `number_of_debts`.\n\n5.  **\"不重复的\" (Distinctness)**: The request mentions \"不重复的名字、姓氏、性别\".\n    *   If `contacts.id` is the primary key of the `contacts` table, then each row processed from `contacts c` represents a unique contact entity.\n    *   The `LEFT JOIN` to `genders` (assuming `genders.id` is also a primary key) will not create duplicate rows for a single contact.\n    *   The correlated subquery calculates the debt count specifically for each `c.id`.\n    *   Therefore, each row generated by the query (before any explicit `DISTINCT` keyword) will already be unique for each contact person, showing their unique combination of first name, last name, gender, and their specific debt count.\n    *   An explicit `DISTINCT` at the top level (as in the reference solution) would be redundant if `contacts.id` is indeed a primary key ensuring unique contact entities. It wouldn't harm correctness but might add a slight overhead. The query is structured to provide one row per contact from the `contacts` table.\n\nCombining these steps, the query becomes:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    c.first_name,\n    c.last_name,\n    g.name AS gender,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debts d WHERE d.contact_id = c.id) AS number_of_debts\nFROM\n    contacts c\nLEFT JOIN\n    genders g ON c.gender_id = g.id;\n```", "db_name": "monica-database", "result": [["Tracie", "Yakovliv", "Male", 1], ["Amelita", "Moy", "Genderqueer", 1], ["Dmitri", "Spry", "Non-binary", 1], ["Deanne", "Couttes", "Two-Spirit", 1], ["Kristina", "Geane", "Genderqueer", 1]]}

Understanding the Goal:**\n\nThe core request is to find the top 10 departments based on the total number of feedback entries received by teachers belonging to those departments. We need to output the department name and its corresponding feedback count.\n\n**2. Identifying Necessary Tables:**\n\nBased on the question, we'll need information from a few tables:\n\n*   **`feedbacks`**: This table will contain the individual feedback records. We'll need it to count the feedback. It likely has a foreign key pointing to the teacher who received the feedback (e.g., `teacher_id`).\n*   **`users` (or `teachers`)**: This table will store information about the teachers, including which department they belong to. It will have a primary key (e.g., `id`) and a foreign key for the department (e.g., `department_id`).\n*   **`departments`**: This table will store the names of the departments. It will have a primary key (e.g., `id`) and a column for the department name (e.g., `department_name`).\n\n**3. Determining Joins:**\n\nTo connect these pieces of information, we'll need to join the tables:\n\n*   First, we connect `feedbacks` to `users` (let's assume the teacher's ID in the `feedbacks` table is `teacher_id` and it links to `id` in the `users` table). This allows us to associate each feedback with a specific teacher.\n    *   `feedbacks AS f JOIN users AS u_teacher ON f.teacher_id = u_teacher.id`\n*   Next, we connect `users` to `departments` (let's assume the department ID in the `users` table is `department_id` and it links to `id` in the `departments` table). This allows us to associate each teacher (and thus their feedback) with a department.\n    *   `... JOIN departments AS d ON u_teacher.department_id = d.id`\n\n**4. Aggregation:**\n\nThe question asks for the *total number of feedback entries* per department. This means we need to:\n\n*   Count the feedback records. `COUNT(f.id)` or `COUNT(*)` within the context of feedback records for a department would work. Using `COUNT(f.id)` is slightly more specific, counting actual feedback entries.\n*   Group the results by department. We want one row per department in our aggregated result. So, we'll use `GROUP BY d.department_name`.\n\n**5. Ordering:**\n\nThe request is for the departments with the *most* feedback, specifically the *top 10*. This requires ordering the results:\n\n*   We need to order by the feedback count in descending order (highest first).\n    *   `ORDER BY feedback_count DESC` (where `feedback_count` is the alias for our count).\n\n**6. Limiting Results:**\n\nWe only need the *top 10* departments.\n\n*   `LIMIT 10`\n\n**7. Selecting Columns:**\n\nThe final output should show the department name and its feedback count.\n\n*   `SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(f.id) AS feedback_count`\n\n**8. Constructing the Full Query:**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  d.department_name,\n  COUNT(f.id) AS feedback_count\nFROM\n  feedbacks AS f\nJOIN\n  users AS u_teacher ON f.teacher_id = u_teacher.id\nJOIN\n  departments AS d ON u_teacher.department_id = d.id\nGROUP BY\n  d.department_name\nORDER BY\n  feedback_count DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis query follows the logic derived: it joins feedback to teachers, then teachers to departments, counts the feedback per department, orders by this count in descending order, and finally limits to the top 10 results. The selected columns are exactly what the question asks for.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  d.department_name,\n  COUNT(f.id) AS feedback_count\nFROM\n  feedbacks AS f\nJOIN\n  users AS u_teacher ON f.teacher_id = u_teacher.id\nJOIN\n  departments AS d ON u_teacher.department_id = d.id\nGROUP BY\n  d.department_name\nORDER BY\n  feedback_count DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```", "db_name": "unified-transform", "result": [["Sales", 10], ["Research and Development", 10], ["Operations", 10], ["Marketing", 10], ["Legal", 10]]}
{"question": "请找出那些至少包含一个章节，该章节下至少有一个页面，且该页面至少有一个修订记录的书籍，并返回这些书籍的ID、名称和描述信息。", "sql": "SELECT\n  b.id AS book_id,\n  b.name AS book_name,\n  b.description AS book_description\nFROM books AS b\nWHERE EXISTS (\n  SELECT 1\n  FROM chapters AS c\n  INNER JOIN pages AS p ON c.id = p.chapter_id\n  INNER JOIN page_revisions AS pr ON p.id = pr.page_id\n  WHERE c.book_id = b.id\n);", "cot": "Okay, let's break down the process of translating this natural language question into an SQL query.\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Request:**\n\nThe main goal is to identify specific books. The criteria for these books involve a hierarchical structure: a book must have at least one chapter, that chapter must have at least one page, and that page must have at least one revision. For the books that meet these criteria, we need to retrieve their ID, name, and description.\n\n**2. Identifying the Main Table and Output Columns:**\n\nThe information we need to return (ID, name, description) directly relates to books. So, the primary table for our `SELECT` statement will be `books`. We'll alias it as `b` for brevity.\n\nThe output columns will be:\n*   `b.id` (Book ID)\n*   `b.name` (Book Name)\n*   `b.description` (Book Description)\n\nFor clarity in the results, we can alias these columns, for example, as `book_id`, `book_name`, and `book_description`.\n\n**3. Translating the Conditions:**\n\nThe question specifies a set of conditions that must all be true for a book to be included:\n\n*   **\"至少包含一个章节\" (at least one chapter):** This means for a given book, there must be an associated record in the `chapters` table.\n*   **\"该章节下至少有一个页面\" (that chapter has at least one page):** This means for a chapter identified in the previous step, there must be an associated record in the `pages` table.\n*   **\"且该页面至少有一个修订记录\" (and that page has at least one revision):** This means for a page identified in the previous step, there must be an associated record in the `page_revisions` table.\n\n**4. Choosing the Right SQL Construct for Existence Checks:**\n\nThe phrase \"at least one\" strongly suggests an existence check. In SQL, the `EXISTS` operator is ideal for this. It checks if a subquery returns any rows. This is generally more efficient than using `JOIN`s and then `DISTINCT` for such \"at least one\" scenarios, as `EXISTS` can stop processing the subquery as soon as the condition is met.\n\n**5. Building the Subquery for `EXISTS`:**\n\nThe subquery will verify the chain of existence (chapter -> page -> revision) for each book:\n\n*   We start by looking at the `chapters` table (aliased as `c`). We need to link these chapters to the current book being evaluated in the outer query. This is done with `WHERE c.book_id = b.id`.\n*   Next, we ensure this chapter `c` has at least one page. We `INNER JOIN` `chapters` with the `pages` table (aliased as `p`) using the condition `c.id = p.chapter_id`. An `INNER JOIN` here naturally filters out chapters without pages.\n*   Then, we ensure this page `p` has at least one revision. We `INNER JOIN` `pages` with the `page_revisions` table (aliased as `pr`) using the condition `p.id = pr.page_id`. This filters out pages without revisions.\n*   The `SELECT` clause of the subquery can be `SELECT 1` (or any constant/column). We only care if *any* row is returned by this subquery, not what data it contains. `SELECT 1` is a common convention.\n\n**6. Assembling the Final Query:**\n\nCombining these parts, we get the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  b.id AS book_id,\n  b.name AS book_name,\n  b.description AS book_description\nFROM books AS b\nWHERE EXISTS (\n  SELECT 1\n  FROM chapters AS c\n  INNER JOIN pages AS p ON c.id = p.chapter_id\n  INNER JOIN page_revisions AS pr ON p.id = pr.page_id\n  WHERE c.book_id = b.id\n);\n```\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning Summary:**\n\n1.  **Target Data:** We need `id`, `name`, `description` from the `books` table.\n2.  **Condition Type:** The conditions are hierarchical existence checks (\"at least one...\").\n3.  **SQL Operator for Existence:** `EXISTS` is the most appropriate and often most efficient operator for this.\n4.  **Outer Query Structure:** `SELECT b.id, b.name, b.description FROM books AS b WHERE EXISTS (...)`.\n5.  **Subquery Logic:**\n    *   Start from `chapters` and correlate it to the outer query's book: `FROM chapters AS c WHERE c.book_id = b.id`.\n    *   Ensure the chapter has a page: `INNER JOIN pages AS p ON c.id = p.chapter_id`.\n    *   Ensure the page has a revision: `INNER JOIN page_revisions AS pr ON p.id = pr.page_id`.\n    *   The subquery's `SELECT` clause is `SELECT 1` as only row existence matters.\n6.  **Column Aliasing:** Use aliases like `book_id`, `book_name`, `book_description` for clearer output column names.\n\nThis query accurately reflects the natural language question by selecting books for which a complete path from book -> chapter -> page -> revision exists.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  b.id AS book_id,\n  b.name AS book_name,\n  b.description AS book_description\nFROM books AS b\nWHERE EXISTS (\n  SELECT 1\n  FROM chapters AS c\n  INNER JOIN pages AS p ON c.id = p.chapter_id\n  INNER JOIN page_revisions AS pr ON p.id = pr.page_id\n  WHERE c.book_id = b.id\n);\n```", "db_name": "bookstack-database", "result": [[1, "Maple Oatmeal", "Eo delectu rerum, quem modo dixi, constituto, ut aut voluptates omittantur maiorum voluptatum adipiscendarum causa aut."], [2, "Salt and Pepper Grinder Set", "Ordinem adiungimus, quid habent, cur Graeca anteponant iis, quae et splendide dicta sint neque."], [3, "Pet Training Pads", "Triarium, minus ab eo ortum, tam inportuno tamque crudeli; sin, ut dolore suo sanciret militaris imperii."], [4, "Spinach Artichoke Dip", "Sit tam insolens domesticarum rerum fastidium.

This will come from the `sylius_shipping_method` table.\n    *   **Adjustments**: We need the `amount` (to sum up), `id` (to count total adjustments), and `type` (to list distinct types). This will come from the `sylius_adjustment` table.\n    *   **Shipments**: We need to count distinct shipments (`id`) that have adjustments and find the `shipped_at` date for the earliest adjusted shipment. This will come from the `sylius_shipment` table.\n\n2.  **Determine Necessary Joins**:\n    *   Adjustments are linked to shipments. We'll need to join `sylius_adjustment` (aliased as `sa`) with `sylius_shipment` (aliased as `ss`) on the shipment ID (e.g., `sa.shipment_id = ss.id`).

We'll need to join `sylius_shipment` (`ss`) with `sylius_shipping_method` (aliased as `ssm`) on the method ID (e.g., `ss.method_id = ssm.id`). This join allows us to get the `code` for each shipping method.\n\n3.  **Select the Required Columns and Aggregations**:\n    *   `ssm.code AS shipping_method_code`: To display the shipping method code.\n    *   `SUM(sa.amount) AS total_adjustment_amount`: To calculate the total sum of adjustment amounts for each shipping method.\n    *   `COUNT(sa.id) AS count_of_adjustments`: To count the total number of adjustment entries for each shipping method.\n    *   `COUNT(DISTINCT ss.id) AS count_of_shipments_with_adjustments`: To count the number of unique shipments that had at least one adjustment.\n    *   `GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT sa.type) AS distinct_adjustment_types`: To list all unique types of adjustments applied.

For these agreements, we need to aggregate refund information.\n\n2.  **Tables Identification:**\n    *   `djpaypal_billingagreement` (aliased as `t3`): Contains billing agreement details like ID (`id`), name (`name`), start date (`start_date`), and description (`description`). This is the primary entity for the output.\n    *   `djpaypal_sale` (used in a subquery aliased as `t2`): Contains sales records, including `id` (sale's own ID), `billing_agreement_id` (to link to `t3`), `exchange_rate`, and `soft_descriptor`.\n    *   `djpaypal_refund` (aliased as `t1`): Contains refund details like `id` (refund's own ID, for counting), `sale_id` (to link to sales), `create_time`, `reason`, and `state`.\n\n3.  **Filtering Conditions:**\n    *   **For Billing Agreements (`t3`):** The description must contain more than three commas. This is translated to the SQLite expression `(LENGTH(t3.description) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t3.description, ',', ''))) > 3`. This filter is applied in the main query's `WHERE` clause.\n    *   **For Sales (in subquery `t2`):** Associated sales records must have an exchange rate greater than 70 (`CAST(exchange_rate AS REAL) > 70`) AND their soft descriptor must contain \"omnium\" (case-insensitive: `LOWER(soft_descriptor) LIKE '%omnium%'`). These sales are filtered within a subquery `t2` to isolate qualifying sales.\n\n4.  **Join Strategy:**\n    *   The `djpaypal_billingagreement` table (`t3`) is the main focus. It is `INNER JOIN`ed with the subquery `t2` (which represents sales already filtered by their criteria). The join condition is `t3.id = t2.billing_agreement_id`. This ensures that we only consider billing agreements that are associated with at least one sale meeting the specified sales criteria.\n    *   The result of the above join (qualifying billing agreements and their associated qualifying sales from `t2`) is then `LEFT JOIN`ed with `djpaypal_refund` (`t1`) on `t2.id = t1.sale_id` (where `t2.id` is the `sale.id` from the subquery). A `LEFT JOIN` is crucial here because the question asks to list details for \"each such agreement,\" implying that if an agreement qualifies based on its own and its sales' criteria, it should be listed, even if it has no associated refunds. In such cases, refund-related aggregates will be 0 or NULL.\n\n5.  **Selected Columns and Aggregations:**\n    *   `t3.id AS billing_agreement_id`: The ID of the billing agreement.\n    *   `t3.name AS billing_agreement_name`: The name of the billing agreement.\n    *   `t3.start_date AS billing_agreement_start_date`: The start date of the billing agreement. This column is included in the `GROUP BY` clause to ensure it can be selected directly.\n    *   `COUNT(t1.id) AS number_of_refunds`: Total number of refunds. `COUNT(t1.id)` correctly handles the `LEFT JOIN` by counting non-NULL `t1.id`s, resulting in 0 if no refunds are associated with the qualifying sales.\n    *   `MIN(t1.create_time) AS earliest_refund_time`: The earliest refund creation time. This will be `NULL` if no refunds exist.\n    *   `GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT t1.reason) AS distinct_refund_reasons`: A comma-separated string of unique refund reasons. This will be `NULL` if no refunds exist or if all reasons are NULL.\n    *   `SUM(CASE WHEN t1.state = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS completed_refunds`: Count of refunds in the 'completed' state.\n    *   `SUM(CASE WHEN t1.state = 'pending' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pending_refunds`: Count of refunds in the 'pending' state.\n\n6.  **Grouping:**\n    *   `GROUP BY t3.id, t3.name, t3.start_date`: The results are grouped by the billing agreement's ID, name, and start date. This allows the aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `GROUP_CONCAT`) to operate on the refunds associated with each unique billing agreement.\n\n7.  **Ordering:**\n    *   `ORDER BY billing_agreement_id ASC`: The final result set is sorted by the billing agreement ID in ascending order, as requested.\n\n8.  **Subquery for Sales (`t2`):**\n    *   A subquery is employed to select `id` (sale ID) and `billing_agreement_id` from `djpaypal_sale` for those sales that meet the exchange rate and soft descriptor criteria. This approach helps in organizing the query and clearly separating the filtering logic for sales.\n\n9.  **Data Type and String Operations:**\n    *   `CAST(exchange_rate AS REAL)`: This is used to ensure that the `exchange_rate` column is treated as a numeric type for the comparison `> 70`, which is important if the column is stored as text.\n    *   `LOWER(soft_descriptor) LIKE '%omnium%'`: Converts the `soft_descriptor` to lowercase before performing a `LIKE` comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive search for \"omnium\".\n    *   `(LENGTH(t3.description) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t3.description, ',', '')))`: This expression calculates the number of commas in the `description` string, a common way to count character occurrences in SQLite.\n\nThis detailed reasoning leads to the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    t3.id AS billing_agreement_id,\n    t3.name AS billing_agreement_name,\n    t3.start_date AS billing_agreement_start_date,\n    COUNT(t1.id) AS number_of_refunds,\n    MIN(t1.create_time) AS earliest_refund_time,\n    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT t1.reason) AS distinct_refund_reasons,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN t1.state = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS completed_refunds,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN t1.state = 'pending' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pending_refunds\nFROM\n    djpaypal_billingagreement AS t3\nJOIN\n    (\n        SELECT\n            id,\n            billing_agreement_id\n        FROM\n            djpaypal_sale\n        WHERE\n            CAST(exchange_rate AS REAL) > 70 AND LOWER(soft_descriptor) LIKE '%omnium%'\n    ) AS t2 ON t3.id = t2.billing_agreement_id\nLEFT JOIN\n    djpaypal_refund AS t1 ON t2.id = t1.sale_id\nWHERE\n    (LENGTH(t3.description) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t3.description, ',', ''))) > 3\nGROUP BY\n    t3.id, t3.name, t3.start_date\nORDER BY\n    billing_agreement_id ASC;\n```", "db_name": "dj-paypal", "result": [["6c9ae6cd-300b-447d-a4c7-ff782d70664f", "Bridget Shawe", 1, "2025-01-15 21:17:19", "Quod quamquam Aristippi est a Cyrenaicisque melius liberiusque defenditur, tamen eius modi esse iudico, ut nihil homine videatur indignius.
