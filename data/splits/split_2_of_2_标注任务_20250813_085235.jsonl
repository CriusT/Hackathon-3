Each row in this table represents a single like.\n\n2.  **Join the Tables**:\n    *   First, we need to connect `discussions` to `posts` to associate posts with their respective discussions. This is done by joining `discussions.id` with `posts.discussion_id`.\n    *   Next, we need to connect `posts` to `post_likes` to count the likes for each post. This is done by joining `posts.id` with `post_likes.post_id`.\n\n3.  **Aggregate Likes per Discussion**:\n    *   To find the total likes for each discussion, we need to count the number of entries in `post_likes` that are associated with posts belonging to that discussion.\n    *   This requires a `GROUP BY` clause. We will group by the discussion's `id` and `title`. Grouping by `id` ensures correct aggregation, and including `title` allows it to be in the `SELECT` statement without an aggregate function.\n\n4.  **Count the Likes**:\n    *   Use the `COUNT()` aggregate function on a column from the `post_likes` table (e.g., `post_likes.post_id` or `post_likes.user_id`, or even `COUNT(*)` after the joins are established) to get the total number of likes for each group (discussion).\n\n5.  **Select Desired Columns**:\n    *   The question asks for the discussion `title` and its `total_likes_in_discussion`.\n\n6.  **Order the Results**:\n    *   The results must be sorted by the total number of likes in descending order (\"从高到低\").\n\n7.  **Limit the Results**:\n    *   Only the top 10 discussions are required.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the SQL query is constructed as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  d.title AS discussion_title,\n  COUNT(pl.post_id) AS total_likes_in_discussion\nFROM discussions AS d\nJOIN posts AS p\n  ON d.id = p.discussion_id\nJOIN post_likes AS pl\n  ON p.id = pl.post_id\nGROUP BY\n  d.id, d.title\nORDER BY\n  total_likes_in_discussion DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```", "db_name": "flarum-database", "result": [["Quod", 1], ["Non miser", 1], ["Quocirca eodem", 1], ["Conficiuntque", 1], ["Finis quid", 1]]}
{"question": "请查询系统中所有那些其关联用户确实存在的事件的详细信息，包括这些事件的ID、标题、描述、用户ID、学校ID、创建时间、更新时间、文件路径以及它们的活动状态。", "sql": "SELECT\n  e.id,\n  e.title,\n  e.description,\n  e.user_id,\n  e.school_id,\n  e.created_at,\n  e.updated_at,\n  e.file_path,\n  e.active\nFROM events AS e\nWHERE EXISTS (\n  SELECT\n    1\n  FROM users AS u\n  WHERE\n    u.id = e.user_id\n);", "cot": "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the SQL query from the natural language question:\n\n1.  **Identify the core data to retrieve**: The question asks for \"事件的详细信息\" (detailed information of events). This means the primary table we'll be querying is `events`.\n\n2.  **Determine the specific columns needed**: The question explicitly lists the required event details: \"ID、标题、描述、用户ID、学校ID、创建时间、更新时间、文件路径以及它们的活动状态\". These translate to the following columns from the `events` table:\n    *   `id`\n    *   `title`\n    *   `description`\n    *   `user_id`\n    *   `school_id`\n    *   `created_at`\n    *   `updated_at`\n    *   `file_path`\n    *   `active`\n\n3.  **Formulate the `SELECT` clause**: Based on the required columns, the `SELECT` clause will look like this (using `e` as an alias for the `events` table for brevity):\n    ```sql\n    SELECT\n      e.id,\n      e.title,\n      e.description,\n      e.user_id,\n      e.school_id,\n      e.created_at,\n      e.updated_at,\n      e.file_path,\n      e.active\n    FROM events AS e\n    ```\n\n4.  **Identify the filtering condition**: The crucial part of the question is \"其关联用户确实存在\" (its associated user actually exists). This means we only want events for which the `user_id` listed in the `events` table corresponds to a valid user in the `users` table.\n\n5.  **Translate the filtering condition into an SQL `WHERE` clause**:\n    *   To check for the existence of a related user, we can use a subquery with the `EXISTS` operator.\n    *   The subquery will need to look into the `users` table.\n    *   It will check if there's any row in `users` (aliased as `u`) where `u.id` matches the `e.user_id` from the current event row in the outer query.\n    *   The `EXISTS` condition becomes: `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users AS u WHERE u.id = e.user_id)`. The `SELECT 1` is a common convention in `EXISTS` subqueries, as we only care about whether any row is returned, not its content.\n\n6.  **Combine all parts**: Putting the `SELECT` clause, `FROM` clause, and `WHERE` clause together, we get the final query.\n\nThis leads to the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  e.id,\n  e.title,\n  e.description,\n  e.user_id,\n  e.school_id,\n  e.created_at,\n  e.updated_at,\n  e.file_path,\n  e.active\nFROM events AS e\nWHERE EXISTS (\n  SELECT\n    1\n  FROM users AS u\n  WHERE\n    u.id = e.user_id\n);\n```", "db_name": "unified-transform", "result": [[1, "Aequi", "Comparandae voluptatis -- Quam autem ego dicam voluptatem, iam videtis, ne invidia verbi labefactetur oratio mea --.

For these agreements, we need to aggregate refund information.\n\n2.  **Tables Identification:**\n    *   `djpaypal_billingagreement` (aliased as `t3`): Contains billing agreement details like ID (`id`), name (`name`), start date (`start_date`), and description (`description`). This is the primary entity for the output.\n    *   `djpaypal_sale` (used in a subquery aliased as `t2`): Contains sales records, including `id` (sale's own ID), `billing_agreement_id` (to link to `t3`), `exchange_rate`, and `soft_descriptor`.\n    *   `djpaypal_refund` (aliased as `t1`): Contains refund details like `id` (refund's own ID, for counting), `sale_id` (to link to sales), `create_time`, `reason`, and `state`.\n\n3.  **Filtering Conditions:**\n    *   **For Billing Agreements (`t3`):** The description must contain more than three commas. This is translated to the SQLite expression `(LENGTH(t3.description) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t3.description, ',', ''))) > 3`. This filter is applied in the main query's `WHERE` clause.\n    *   **For Sales (in subquery `t2`):** Associated sales records must have an exchange rate greater than 70 (`CAST(exchange_rate AS REAL) > 70`) AND their soft descriptor must contain \"omnium\" (case-insensitive: `LOWER(soft_descriptor) LIKE '%omnium%'`). These sales are filtered within a subquery `t2` to isolate qualifying sales.\n\n4.  **Join Strategy:**\n    *   The `djpaypal_billingagreement` table (`t3`) is the main focus. It is `INNER JOIN`ed with the subquery `t2` (which represents sales already filtered by their criteria). The join condition is `t3.id = t2.billing_agreement_id`. This ensures that we only consider billing agreements that are associated with at least one sale meeting the specified sales criteria.\n    *   The result of the above join (qualifying billing agreements and their associated qualifying sales from `t2`) is then `LEFT JOIN`ed with `djpaypal_refund` (`t1`) on `t2.id = t1.sale_id` (where `t2.id` is the `sale.id` from the subquery). A `LEFT JOIN` is crucial here because the question asks to list details for \"each such agreement,\" implying that if an agreement qualifies based on its own and its sales' criteria, it should be listed, even if it has no associated refunds. In such cases, refund-related aggregates will be 0 or NULL.\n\n5.  **Selected Columns and Aggregations:**\n    *   `t3.id AS billing_agreement_id`: The ID of the billing agreement.\n    *   `t3.name AS billing_agreement_name`: The name of the billing agreement.\n    *   `t3.start_date AS billing_agreement_start_date`: The start date of the billing agreement. This column is included in the `GROUP BY` clause to ensure it can be selected directly.\n    *   `COUNT(t1.id) AS number_of_refunds`: Total number of refunds. `COUNT(t1.id)` correctly handles the `LEFT JOIN` by counting non-NULL `t1.id`s, resulting in 0 if no refunds are associated with the qualifying sales.\n    *   `MIN(t1.create_time) AS earliest_refund_time`: The earliest refund creation time. This will be `NULL` if no refunds exist.\n    *   `GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT t1.reason) AS distinct_refund_reasons`: A comma-separated string of unique refund reasons. This will be `NULL` if no refunds exist or if all reasons are NULL.\n    *   `SUM(CASE WHEN t1.state = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS completed_refunds`: Count of refunds in the 'completed' state.\n    *   `SUM(CASE WHEN t1.state = 'pending' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pending_refunds`: Count of refunds in the 'pending' state.\n\n6.  **Grouping:**\n    *   `GROUP BY t3.id, t3.name, t3.start_date`: The results are grouped by the billing agreement's ID, name, and start date. This allows the aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `GROUP_CONCAT`) to operate on the refunds associated with each unique billing agreement.\n\n7.  **Ordering:**\n    *   `ORDER BY billing_agreement_id ASC`: The final result set is sorted by the billing agreement ID in ascending order, as requested.\n\n8.  **Subquery for Sales (`t2`):**\n    *   A subquery is employed to select `id` (sale ID) and `billing_agreement_id` from `djpaypal_sale` for those sales that meet the exchange rate and soft descriptor criteria. This approach helps in organizing the query and clearly separating the filtering logic for sales.\n\n9.  **Data Type and String Operations:**\n    *   `CAST(exchange_rate AS REAL)`: This is used to ensure that the `exchange_rate` column is treated as a numeric type for the comparison `> 70`, which is important if the column is stored as text.\n    *   `LOWER(soft_descriptor) LIKE '%omnium%'`: Converts the `soft_descriptor` to lowercase before performing a `LIKE` comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive search for \"omnium\".\n    *   `(LENGTH(t3.description) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t3.description, ',', '')))`: This expression calculates the number of commas in the `description` string, a common way to count character occurrences in SQLite.\n\nThis detailed reasoning leads to the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    t3.id AS billing_agreement_id,\n    t3.name AS billing_agreement_name,\n    t3.start_date AS billing_agreement_start_date,\n    COUNT(t1.id) AS number_of_refunds,\n    MIN(t1.create_time) AS earliest_refund_time,\n    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT t1.reason) AS distinct_refund_reasons,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN t1.state = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS completed_refunds,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN t1.state = 'pending' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pending_refunds\nFROM\n    djpaypal_billingagreement AS t3\nJOIN\n    (\n        SELECT\n            id,\n            billing_agreement_id\n        FROM\n            djpaypal_sale\n        WHERE\n            CAST(exchange_rate AS REAL) > 70 AND LOWER(soft_descriptor) LIKE '%omnium%'\n    ) AS t2 ON t3.id = t2.billing_agreement_id\nLEFT JOIN\n    djpaypal_refund AS t1 ON t2.id = t1.sale_id\nWHERE\n    (LENGTH(t3.description) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t3.description, ',', ''))) > 3\nGROUP BY\n    t3.id, t3.name, t3.start_date\nORDER BY\n    billing_agreement_id ASC;\n```", "db_name": "dj-paypal", "result": [["6c9ae6cd-300b-447d-a4c7-ff782d70664f", "Bridget Shawe", 1, "2025-01-15 21:17:19", "Quod quamquam Aristippi est a Cyrenaicisque melius liberiusque defenditur, tamen eius modi esse iudico, ut nihil homine videatur indignius.
